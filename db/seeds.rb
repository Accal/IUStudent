# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# 5.times do |course|
#   Course.create!(
#     code: course,
#     name: "Course #{course}",
#     instructor: "Instructor #{course}",
#     period1: "14:20",
#     period2: "14:00",
#     venue: "Venue #{course}"
#   )
# end

# puts "10 courses created"
